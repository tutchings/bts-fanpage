    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Bangtan Sonyeondan, better known as BTS, is a K-Pop group based out of
        Seoul, South Korea. While the group began formation in 2010, they
        didn't debut until 2013 when their album "2 Cool 4 Skool" was released.
        While the group had humble beginnings, they have since become one of the
        most successful, popular, and recognizeable icons in the music industry worldwide.
    </p> 

    <p>
        The seven-member group is managed by Big Hit Entertainment, a large
        South Korean entertainment company. Founded in 2005 by Bang Si-hyuk, Big Hit Entertainent
        also manages soloist Lee Hyun as well as TXT, another big K-Pop group.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Korean, the groups name, Bangtan Soyeondan, translates to "Bulletproof Boy Scouts." BTS member
        J-Hope states that the name alludes to the groups objective "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, 
        and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets, to preserve the values and ideal of today's
        adolescents" (Trabasso 1).
